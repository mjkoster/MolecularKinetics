# O24U

An open source oxygen generator designed to deliver 10-20 liters per minute of medical grade oxygen

### Highlights:
* PSA air separator with design parameters in the same range as oxykit 
* Incorporates a silica-based air dryer using TSA to regenerate
* Highly serviceable using common tools and skills
* All-metal construction with tri-clamp and SAE flare service connections
* Built mostly from commonly available components with some easily-fabricated brackets and mounting plates
* Uses a standard 19 inch electronics rack as the central mounting frame
* Research unit with additional monitor and control points
* Control system using model-driven approach and rapid prototyping
* Network connection to enable remote management and diagnostics

### Package contents:
* High level documentation and images for the assembled system and sub-components
* BOM and component specifications
* Design/CNC files for the fabricated components
* Schematics and PCB fabrication files
* Control system models and code generators for Arduino and Node-RED modules
* Arduino framework code for RTUs
* Node-RED framework code for PLC Brain
* Pre-built runnable code for the full prototype system
